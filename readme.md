Port of old Connect4 project of mine (pre-2013) to TypeScript for much better code readability and future extension

## Debugging
To build the TypeScript files, enter the following command:
` npx webpack -w `
or simply run:
` npm start `

In order to take advantage of source map during debugging, do the following in the Chrome devtools:
- Click the Sources tab.
- Then click the Filesystem tab within Sources and click "Add folder to workspace".
- Navigate to the src folder on your environment.
- Reload the page and feel free to set breakpoints in the code.
